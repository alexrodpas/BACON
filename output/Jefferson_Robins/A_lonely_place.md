# A lonely place
_by Jefferson Robins_


I woke up today in a lonely place  
Of perfect peace, as obsolete as social music.  
And out of doors I saw draining wings upon the walls,  
A desolated farm where fifty thousand souls bit their tongues,  
A black wind that blew away their wooden bodies.  

I run across the fields to the streets  
Where a secret death awaited me  
Hidden behind the little tubes  
among the telephones and the tabloids.  

I was then the piece of linen palm that  
Saw the world as it was before the blinding,  
That dreadful day of March.
