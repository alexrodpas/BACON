# I think I want to be a summer afternoon #
_by Jefferson Robins_

I think I want to be a summer afternoon,  
see a baby rain, the water down the empty streets,  
the corner, the Sun, the south,  
the brilliant star between the stars.  

A man of God told me that every poet  
is afraid to say the words and instantly  
find the other way to the end of the world,  
one day a little bit a mile away, and then  
forever standing on the highest mountain.
