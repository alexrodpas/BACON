# Prophet
_by Jefferson Robins_

In the Temple where saints take with them the world,  
built on the streets of the Town of Toot,  
you are nothing but an adaptation of him,  
a prophet who arrives with a truth  
that cannot be denied by the beauty of these stanzas.  

You could have been conscious if only  
your thoughts were given to all those that  
weave the world on their own, day by day,  
as every third man with a bloody breath  
and his soul lost by the story of others.
