# The ancient grammar clock
_by Jefferson Robins_

The ancient grammar clock of all the poets who write about  
The grease of common events  
Brought me a larger loneliness of broken bones  
A paper rope of wooden broad desks  
Besides the bridge, above the sky.  

I once met a bum who liked to say 'We'll tally up and keep the stars',  
A soulmate that could make a statement simple  
And not stain my heart with the strength to teach the poems  
To the friends that ate garbage in the war.
