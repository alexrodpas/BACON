# The dead who walk the world to East
_by Jefferson Robins_

The sky is filthy foliage,  
The rain a sonnet in a book of other corpses  
The sea is stumbling as she ever seemed  
To want to walk across the room.  

I see the sacrificial dismiss of the strong,  
The ancient stones that threw the words together  
And afterward applauded all the patterns  
And paid the only debt of former lovers.
