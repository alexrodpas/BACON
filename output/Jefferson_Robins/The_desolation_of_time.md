# The desolation of time
_by Jefferson Robins_

When shall we be sad with an enemy who  
was dead or in his own direction  
through the night that drifts instantly?  
The sea is the refuge of the stream of stars,  
a spirit of consequences that consumes so soon  
that its soul lets us know the secret of  
the desolation of time.
