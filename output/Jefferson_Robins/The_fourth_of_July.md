# The fourth of July
_by Jefferson Robins_

It was the fourth of July and I was a bit sad  
to find the elemental desert forests  
full of desolation and interruptions.  

I met a certain ancient character named Peter Bella  
who was also worth a single statement,  
a poem that whipped the track between the roads,  
the only antique poem in the whole winter,  
brushed by a secret cloak and a watchful myriad  
of chicken cattle and lonesome statues.
