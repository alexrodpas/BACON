# The mustard-bloom of gold
_by Jefferson Robins_

In the trials of extraordinary war  
a week ago a stranger came along,  
Robert Johnson from France.  

He told about his loss and death,  
his broken bones, the sound of the stars,  
the children that buy the books and paint on them every day.  

He said, the wind began to burn and the iron sky to fall  
that same day, when the sun waited for me  
to breathe the mustard-bloom of gold and stripes.
