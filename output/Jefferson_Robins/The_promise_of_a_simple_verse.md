# The promise of a simple verse
_by Jefferson Robins_

The poems that Robert Albert Prest collected  
To photograph the hospitality and beauty  
Of the thousand stars that fade again too often  
Are now calling families seventy miles away.  

The poems wildly wrecked by the wrinkled earth  
Portend the wrong alert about the evening star  
And chalk a limb alone and pass again together  
With the rusty phantom running thru the strutting air.  

What do these books say about the ants and the citizens,  
And their little legs, about their chilly rattle to carry  
A crowd of thorns, courting the passage of time  
About the black stream of savage love that burns?  

Just that the cause to hold a cure lies within the simple verse  
That adornes the fate of the world with purity and despair.
