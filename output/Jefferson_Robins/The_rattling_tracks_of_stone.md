# The rattling tracks of stone
_by Jefferson Robins_

We wanted the world to be  
a place to think about the mighty animals  
around all the older patterns,  
about the rattling tracks of stone and sky around us,  
about the sympathy of others when their backs,  
their bloody tongues, began to breathe.  

It is now the time to recognize the promise  
made by the pretty child who wrote about the poet;  
that Love and Danger move along  
and the sky is still there and the sun is still there  
and there is nothing to do but drink and  
see the sounds, the other storms, the seeds.
