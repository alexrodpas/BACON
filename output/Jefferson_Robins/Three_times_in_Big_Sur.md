# Three times in Big Sur
_by Jefferson Robins_

The first time we were together where Big Sur begins  
The music moved among the sparks of a dancing bride  
And produced its share of moderate tones and songs.  
The sky wanted to fall asleep and rain  
And trap the stone walls over the lonesome cliffs.  

The second time we were together where Big Sur sleeps  
A man who dropped a pot and twisted his mouth  
told Eugene to see the Irish work and then  
vanished into the watchful fields,  
along the bridge past the vaporous streets.  

The last time we were together where Big Sur ends  
I promised to write about the sacrifice of the poet  
Who once knew how to carefully sew  
the vacant strokes and the hissing vowels   
into the casual fabric of modern days.  

Today the patient sand stirs the silver waves and wakes the stars,  
my life is nothing but a drum of havoc and you can  
contemplate notions of mind, thirst and solitude,  
and expose the old hope that our wretched immortality  
is the only agent and the only myth alive.
