# Today I saw it all across the hills
_by Jefferson Robins_

Today my mother made my father slice the bottle down,  
he scrubbed his hands and said  
'I'm the son of Brendan Buy whose revolution worked  
a mile of summer dusk, and saw the day before  
the Banks of Tarry Flynn, heard the grateful voices,  
touched their skin and eased their eyes.  

His eyes shut the day the angels stalked him,  
among the stars that swarmed the human soul,  
and touched him with their silken hands  
a summer night of a winter week.  

There is no way to say that he was a stranger  
full of despair, of faith and moral grief and solitude.  
For he hates the death of extraordinary people  
in the Civil War whose name the nightingale was circling.
